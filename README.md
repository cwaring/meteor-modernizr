##### Modernizr is a JavaScript library that detects HTML5 and CSS3 features in the userâ€™s browser.

- [Documentation](http://www.modernizr.com/docs/)

Modernizr tests which native CSS3 and HTML5 features are available in the current UA and makes the results available to you in two ways: as properties on a global `Modernizr` object, and as classes on the `<html>` element. This information allows you to progressively enhance your pages with a granular level of control over the experience.
